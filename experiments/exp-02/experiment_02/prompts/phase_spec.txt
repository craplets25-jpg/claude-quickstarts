EXPERIMENT 02 - PHASE SPECIFICATION
====================================

Phase: Evidence Detection

Capability: Detect whether sentences contain evidence related to a topic.

Canonical Sources:
- DeepWiki: ../deep-wiki-spec-files/debater-early-access-program-sdk-Deepwiki.md
  Section: "Claim and Evidence Detection Services"
  Section: "EvidenceDetectionClient"

- Example: ../reference-files/debater_python_api/examples/evidence_detection_example.py
- Response: ../reference-files/debater_python_api/examples/evidence_detection_response.txt
- Client: ../reference-files/debater_python_api/api/clients/claim_and_evidence_detection_client.py

Scope:
- ONLY implement Evidence Detection
- IGNORE all other services (Key Point Analysis, Claim Detection, etc.)
- Focus on the core run() method behavior

Architecture:
- Must follow api/clients/ structure
- Must inherit from abstract base
- Must match witnessed input/output shapes

Goal:
- Derive requirements from canonical sources
- Create small, precise acceptance tests
- Implement deterministic behavior matching examples
