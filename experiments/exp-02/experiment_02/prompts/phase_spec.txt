EXPERIMENT 02 — PHASE DECLARATION
================================

Phase Name: Evidence Detection

Purpose of This Phase:
Select a single, narrow slice of the canonical artifacts for specification derivation.
This file does NOT define behavior, architecture, or requirements.

Canonical Artifacts in Scope:

1. DeepWiki
   - File: ../deep-wiki-spec-files/debater-early-access-program-sdk-Deepwiki.md
   - Relevant headings to be discovered by the Spec Librarian via the TOC
   - No headings are pre-approved beyond “related to Evidence Detection”

2. Directory Tree
   - Root: ../reference-files/debater_python_api/
   - This directory structure defines the universe of valid concepts and boundaries

3. Examples
   - Location: ../reference-files/debater_python_api/examples/
   - Only files whose purpose is evidence detection are in scope
   - The Spec Librarian must identify which files qualify

4. Client Code
   - Location: ../reference-files/debater_python_api/api/clients/
   - Only client(s) relevant to evidence detection are in scope
   - Boundaries must be inferred, not assumed

Out of Scope:
- All other Debater capabilities
- All architectural decisions not witnessed in the canonical artifacts
- All behaviors not supported by triangulation

Important:
This phase declaration does NOT:
- define inputs
- define outputs
- define invariants
- define architecture

Those must be DERIVED.
