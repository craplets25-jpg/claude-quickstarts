# Experiment 02: Document-Driven Derivation

**The Ontological Rule:**
The DeepWiki TOC and the Debater SDK directory tree together define the complete universe of valid concepts.

1. **No Invention** — All behavior must be derived.
2. **Triangulation Required** — A requirement exists only if supported by:
   * DeepWiki (intent),
   * Examples (behavior),
   * Client structure (architecture).
3. **Architecture Constraint** — Code must mirror `api/clients/`. Monoliths are forbidden.
