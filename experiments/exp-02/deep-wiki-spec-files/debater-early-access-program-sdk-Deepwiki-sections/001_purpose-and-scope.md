## Purpose and Scope

The `debater_python_api` package serves as a unified Python SDK for accessing IBM's Project Debater Early Access Program services. The SDK provides programmatic access to multiple natural language processing capabilities, with Key Point Analysis as the primary feature, alongside argument quality assessment, claim detection, evidence detection, text clustering, and other NLP services.

The SDK is designed to handle authentication, request management, data processing, and result formatting for all supported Debater services, providing both low-level API access and high-level utility functions for common tasks.
