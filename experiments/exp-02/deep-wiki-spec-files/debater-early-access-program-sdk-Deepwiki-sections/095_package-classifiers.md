## Package Classifiers

The project includes standard Python package classifiers that help categorize the package in the Python Package Index (PyPI):

- `Programming Language :: Python :: 3` - Indicates Python 3 compatibility
- `Operating System :: OS Independent` - Cross-platform compatibility

These classifiers help users understand the package's compatibility and target environment.
