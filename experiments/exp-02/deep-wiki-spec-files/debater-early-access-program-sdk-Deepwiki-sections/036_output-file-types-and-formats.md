## Output File Types and Formats

The KPA reporting system generates multiple complementary output formats, each serving different analysis and presentation needs.

### File Format Summary

| Format | Purpose | Key Features | Generated By |
|--------|---------|--------------|--------------|
| CSV | Data analysis and processing | Machine-readable, supports external tools | `write_result_to_csv()` |
| JSON | Graph visualization | Interactive graph data, web-compatible | `create_graph_data()` |
| TXT | Simple hierarchy viewing | Plain text bullets, easily shareable | `hierarchical_graph_data_to_textual_bullets()` |
| DOCX | Professional reporting | Formatted documents, navigation, tables | `save_hierarchical_graph_data_to_docx()` |

### Integrated Workflow

The `generate_graphs_and_textual_summary()` method provides a complete reporting workflow that creates all output formats from a single CSV input file. This method can be configured to generate only specific outputs using the `save_only_docx` parameter for focused report generation.

For working with existing hierarchical structures across different result sets, the `generate_graphs_and_textual_summary_for_given_tree()` method applies pre-calculated hierarchies to new data, enabling consistent reporting across related analyses.

This document covers the administrative functionality provided by the `KpAnalysisAdminClient` class for managing users, domains, jobs, and system monitoring in the Key Point Analysis service. This client extends the standard KPA client with elevated permissions for system administration tasks.
