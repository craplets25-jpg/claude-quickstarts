## Purpose and Scope

The `ArgumentQualityClient` provides programmatic access to IBM's Argument Quality service for scoring the quality of sentence-topic pairs. This client evaluates how well a given sentence functions as an argument for a specific topic, returning numerical quality scores.

This document covers the client's API, usage patterns, and integration details. For information about other NLP service clients, see [Text Analysis Clients](#4.3). For details about the underlying client architecture, see [SDK Architecture](#5.1).
