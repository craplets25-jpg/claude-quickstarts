SUMMARY
-------
The requirement cards were generally well-structured with good separation between
behavior and implementation. Most invariants correctly captured technology-agnostic
behavioral requirements.

Key patterns addressed:
1. Specific method name "run" → generalized to "public method as entry point"
2. "API key" authentication → generalized to "authentication credentials"
3. Specific service connection requirements → generalized to "configurable service endpoint"

The cards showed good use of the legacy_notes field to preserve implementation details
from the reference system while keeping invariants focused on behavioral contracts.
Most validation, input/output shape, and ordering requirements were already properly
stated as technology-agnostic behaviors.

Overall assessment: The original card set was high quality with minimal technology
coupling. Only 4 invariants required moving to legacy_notes across 3 cards out of 18
total cards.
