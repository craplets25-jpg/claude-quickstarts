[20:34:53] I'll begin by establishing the universe of truth and finding the canonical artifacts. Let me start by reading the experiment manifesto and phase constraints, then explore the DeepWiki structure.
[20:35:08] Perfect! I can see the phase constraint clearly. Let me now explore the canonical artifacts structure. I'll start by reading the DeepWiki INDEX and finding the Key Point Analysis sections.
[20:37:26] Now let me create the requirement cards. I'll structure them based on the diagrams and canonical evidence, carefully separating BEHAVIOR requirements from LEGACY implementation details:
[20:41:47] Excellent! Now let me create the feature_list.json with acceptance tests. I'll create 35-40 tests that verify the BEHAVIOR requirements (invariants) without asserting vendor-specific values:
[20:48:55] I'll help you review the requirement cards and ensure all technology-specific details are moved to `legacy_notes` while keeping only behavioral invariants. Let me start by reading the current requirem
[20:49:00] Now I'll analyze each card systematically and move all technology-specific implementation details to `legacy_notes` while keeping only behavioral invariants. Let me process this carefully.
[20:55:00] I'll start by orienting myself to the project and following the workflow exactly as specified.  ## Step 1 — Orient (mandatory)  Let me read the required files from the current directory:
[20:55:41] I'll begin by orienting myself to the task and reading the required files.
[20:56:20] Now let me create the implementation. I'll start with a minimal KpAnalysisClient class that satisfies TEST-001:
[21:00:19] I'll start by orienting myself to the task and reading the required files.
[21:03:25] I'll begin by reading the required files from the current directory to orient myself.
[21:05:46] I'll start by orienting myself and reading the required files from the current directory.
