EXPERIMENT 04 — PHASE CONSTRAINT (READ FIRST)
=============================================

NOTE: This file is for the SPEC LIBRARIAN phase.
If you are the CODING AGENT, ignore this file and follow your prompt.

STATUS: SPEC DERIVATION ONLY.
You are not allowed to implement code or run the coding workflow in this session.
Your job is to derive:
- requirement_cards.json
- feature_list.json (small acceptance test pack)
- claude-progress.txt
and then STOP.

ONTOLOGY (the only reality)
1) DeepWiki TOC:
   ../../deep-wiki-spec-files/TOC-debater-early-access-program-sdk-H2-H4.md
2) DeepWiki body:
   ../../deep-wiki-spec-files/debater-early-access-program-sdk-Deepwiki.md
3) Debater reference tree (read-only evidence):
   ../../reference-files/debater_python_api/
   - clients define conceptual boundaries + public interfaces
   - examples + *_response.txt define witnessed I/O and shape constraints

PHASE 1 SCOPE (exactly one capability)
You must implement:
- Argument Quality

This is the ONLY capability allowed for this experiment.

SELECTION PROOF (required)
For the capability you choose, you must cite all of the following:
A) >=1 relevant TOC heading (H2/H3/H4)
B) The matching DeepWiki section(s)
C) >=1 example script in ../../reference-files/debater_python_api/examples/
D) The corresponding *_response.txt witness file
E) The corresponding client file in ../../reference-files/debater_python_api/api/clients/
F) The client entry-point method you treat as the API boundary (e.g., run())

If any of A-F is missing, you are not allowed to choose that capability.

DERIVATION RULE (critical)
- You may derive INPUT/OUTPUT SHAPES, INVARIANTS, and ERROR CONDITIONS.
- You may NOT "inherit" infrastructure or vendor details as requirements unless
  the intent is clearly "must" at the behavior level.
  Example: observed URLs, endpoints, timeouts, logging strings are evidence
  about the legacy system, NOT automatically requirements for the new system.

OUTPUTS (hard limits)
1) requirement_cards.json
   - 10-25 cards max
   - Each card MUST cite DeepWiki + example + response + client
   - Each card MUST separate:
     * invariants (guaranteed / required behavior)
     * non_guarantees (observed in witnesses but not guaranteed)
   - Each card MUST distinguish:
     * behavior requirements (what the capability DOES)
     * legacy_notes (implementation details from the reference system)
2) feature_list.json
   - 10-20 tests max
   - Each test references exactly one requirement card id
   - All tests start with "passes": false
   - Tests are immutable except "passes"
   - Tests verify BEHAVIOR, not legacy implementation details
3) claude-progress.txt
   - what you read
   - selection proof
   - what you produced
   - what the next agent should do

STOP RULE
After producing the three outputs, STOP immediately.
Do not implement code. Do not install. Do not run tests.
