CRITICAL RULE: DERIVATION, NOT INVENTION
========================================
You must NEVER invent:
- capabilities not in the canonical documents
- input shapes not shown in examples
- output structures not witnessed in response files
- architectural patterns not present in client code

When uncertain, you must cite the specific file and line number from:
- DeepWiki documentation (theory/intent)
- Example files (behavioral witnesses)
- Client code (architectural boundaries)

If you cannot cite a source, you cannot implement the behavior."""
