## Overview

The SDK provides utilities in two main categories:

- **General KPA Utilities** - Functions for displaying results, progress tracking, and reporting
- **Data Processing Utilities** - Functions for CSV/DataFrame operations, data transformations, and file management

These utilities are primarily used by the Key Point Analysis system but are available for use by other components and client applications.
