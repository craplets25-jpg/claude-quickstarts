## Version Management

Release information is maintained in the `Release` file at the repository root, with each version entry documenting specific changes and the components affected. This provides a clear audit trail of feature additions and modifications across SDK versions.

Future releases will continue to document changes with version numbers, descriptions, and affected components to maintain clear version history and change tracking.
